# Plex Export Dark Mode
Dark Mode template for Plex Export Plug-in

This is a template based on files created by DpDesignz and modified by me in order to have a Dark Mode for the PLEX Export plug-in.
Original design template (Vanilla) can be found on: https://github.com/dpDesignz/plex-export-responsive-skin

Note: To use the Dark Mode, you have to use all the files from this repository.

# Install:
Just download the repo archive and rewrite the original files. Please first, make a back-up of your files, just in case..
